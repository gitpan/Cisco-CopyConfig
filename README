Cisco::CopyConfig Version 1.3
=============================

INTRODUCTION
============
Cisco::CopyConfig provides methods for manipulating the running-config
of Cisco devices running IOS via SNMP directed TFTP.  This is handy for
making changes or backups on many devices without having to log into each 
device or write messy expect type scripts that need constant tweaking.

Example: Backup the configuration of 'lab-router-a' to 'tftp-server-a':

use Cisco::CopyConfig;

$config = Cisco::CopyConfig->new(
  'Host' => 'lab-router-a',
  'Comm' => 'rw_community_string'
);
$config->copy('tftp-server-a', 'lab-router-a.config');

For those that think SNMP is evil and will open giant security holes, 
consider the following IOS configuration:

access-list 10 permit host 10.0.1.3
access-list 10 deny any
!
snmp-server tftp-server-list 10
snmp-server view backup ciscoMgmt.96.1.1.1.1 included
snmp-server community public view backup RW 10
end

The above only allows a selected "view" of the SNMP MIB and restricts 
what TFTP servers can be used in SNMP calls.  With this method, it is 
trivial to only allow changes or backups on trusted hosts.
